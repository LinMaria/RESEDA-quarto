    "text": "R Crash Course\n\n\nThis is a R crash course for anyone who previously had no or very little contact with script-based programming. It should establish the basic understanding needed for upcoming chapters.\nYou are an old hand in R programming and do not need this introduction? – Skip this section and jump to the next!\nIn order to deepen your knowledge, in particular with a view to statistical analysis, we recommend the advanced elearning course SOGA (Softwaregestützte Geodatenanalyse). User name and password for SOGA are “ilovestats” in a single word. Of course, there are lots of advanced tutorials and relevant literature out there, which should not go unmentioned here.\n\nCrash Course in a Box\nWe subdivided this crash course into several sections. At the end of most sections you will get to test your knowledge with coding exercises (E)!\n1 Package Management\n2 Calculate With R\n3 Variables\n4 Functions + E I\n5 Vectors + E II\n6 Matrices + E III\n7 Lists\n8 Dataframes + E IV\n9 Missing values\n10 Control Structures + E V"

We will have a look at basic and advanced concepts needed for a complete project implementation using remote sensing imagery – with a special focus on automatisation of individual operations and big data processing. This course will provide a great deal of knowledge and valuable expertise for all related fields of environmental earth sciences!\nFor that purpose we will mainly use the statistical programming language R in a Linux environment – but please don’t panic, it’s not as bad as it sounds: You will be led through a complete analysis process, from data acquisition, to import, exploration and finally the export of your results, guided by a lot of reproduceable examples, exercises and pretty pictures!\nKeep in mind that this course content complements and extends the material covered in the classes Fernerkundung und Digitale Bildverarbeitung and Geographische Informationssysteme, both being taught at the Freie Universität Berlin.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Learning Objectives\nThis online course is divided into separate sections covering particular topics, which together provide a whole workflow commonly used for remote sensing imagery. Although the sections are built on one another and we recommend to handle them in given order, feel free to skip parts you are already comfortable with and focus on the chapters you are interested in. In almost every section you will come across exercises, e.g., multiple choice questionnaires or coding exercises to proof your comprehension of previous sections.\nLet us have a look at the learning objectives and checkpoints of each individual section:\n\nPrepare Yourself\ninstall our VirtualBox containing all required software get used to the GUIs of R-Studio, QGIS and SNAP refresh basics of the programming language R (if needed)\n\n\nAcquire Data\n\nrepeat basics of optical and radar imagery\nbecome familiar with online data provider and HUBs\nautomatically download many images using bulk downloads\n\n\n\nAnalyse Your Data\n\nrepeat basics of classification and regression tasks\nclassify image data in R with Random Forest and SVM\nvisualize results in R and QGIS\n\n\n\nValidate Results\n\nrepeat validation basics\nvalidate results in R with state of the art methods\n\n\n\nSAR Processing\n\nget deeper insights in SAR processing\nprocess Sentinel imagery in SNAP\nlearn to do InSAR and texture analysis\n\nWe wish you a lot of creative ideas, much findings and great results!\nBest regards, your FU Berlin Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics staff"
